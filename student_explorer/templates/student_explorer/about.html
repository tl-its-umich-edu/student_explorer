        <h1 class="sub-header">About Student Explorer</h1>
        <p>Student Explorer is an early warning system that <b>helps academic advisors identify at-risk students</b>
            based on current term Learning Management System data. Using visualizations of data about students' current
            term grades and assignments, it presents actionable intelligence to academic advisors. By helping them
            identify students at risk of academic jeopardy, the tool enables advisors to create timely interventions
            directing students toward resources that may facilitate behavioral change and academic growth and success.
            For more information about how Student Explorer works and how to use it, please refer to the
            <a href="https://documentation.its.umich.edu/student-explorer-general" target="_blank">Student Explorer documentation</a>.

        <h2 class="list-header">Student Explorer Access</h2>
        <p>Student Explorer is available to all professional staff/faculty advisors at the U-M Ann Arbor campus upon request for access and includes information about all students on the Ann Arbor campus who use Canvas, including graduate
            students (note: some graduate programs do not use Canvas and those students will not be visible in Student Explorer). Learn more about <a href="https://documentation.its.umich.edu/student-explorer-access" target="_blank">Student Explorer access</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="list-header">About Cohorts</h2>
        <p>You can set up one or more lists of students, called "cohorts," so you can view all your students on your
            <a href="/">"My Students" page</a>. You do not need to have students assigned to you through a cohort to
            use Student Explorer. <a href="https://documentation.its.umich.edu/student-explorer-cohorts">Learn more
                about cohorts and how to create them.</a>
